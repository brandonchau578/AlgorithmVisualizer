🌟 Features
📊 Algorithm Visualizations

Bubble Sort: Watch adjacent elements compare and swap in real-time
Quick Sort: See how partitioning works around pivot elements
Linear Search: Follow the sequential search process step by step

🎮 Interactive Controls

Play/Pause: Control animation timing
Speed Adjustment: Customize animation speed (10% - 100%)
Reset Function: Start over with the same or new data
New Array Generation: Create random datasets for testing

🎨 Visual Elements

Color-coded bars: Different colors for comparing, swapping, and sorted elements
Real-time progress tracking: See exactly which step you're on
Responsive design: Works perfectly on desktop, tablet, and mobile
Smooth animations: Beautiful transitions between algorithm steps
